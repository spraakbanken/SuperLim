Funded by*		
Cite as		List the publication(s) which should be cited when using the resource
Related datasets		Use only for the most crucially related datasets (part of collection; derivative of another dataset). Other information can be provided under Related projects in Block VI.
		
II. USAGE		
Key applications		
Intended task(s)/usage(s)		
Recommended evaluation measures		Use the same numbering as in Intended Task(s)/Usage(s)
Dataset function(s)		
Recommended split(s)		
		
III. DATA		
Primary data*		Text, Speech, Images, Video etc
Language*		
Dataset in numbers*		
Nature of the content*		
Format*		
Data source(s)*		If data was collected from subjects and/or through third party individuals, indicate form of compensation/consent mechanism/future control of subject over data. If dataset is a derived work, mention the sources here, in a way satisfies the licenses of the original work.  If a full specification is too long to give here, refer to other documentation/publication.
Data collection method(s)*		If a full specification is too long to give here, refer to other documentation/publication.
Data selection and filtering*		From the data you collected, how did you select/filter those that are included in the dataset? If there was no selection/filtering, say so. If a full specification is too long to give here, refer to other documentation/publication.
Data preprocessing*		If a full specification is too long to give here, refer to other documentation/publication.
Data labeling*		If you have multiple levels/types of annotation, name them all. For every level, say if the annotation is manual/gold or not, to what extent it can be trusted.
Annotator characteristics		List those characteristics of the annotators that you think the users should know. They will probably vary depending on the nature of the dataset. Do not reveal any sensitive information, do not force annotators to reveal their names etc.
		
IV. ETHICS AND CAVEATS		
Ethical considerations		Does the dataset contain information about individuals, sensitive information about individuals? Are any individuals identifiable (directly/indirectly)? Does it contain information about demographic groups? Has possible impact of the use of the data on individuals/groups been considered? Does the data contain offensive/threatening/triggering material. Was an ethical board involved at any point in the creation of the dataset?
Things to watch out for		"Mention any ""counter-indications"", out of scope usage, (limiting) implications of selection/preprocessing/annotation for future use you are aware of."

Which changes have been made, compared to the previous version*		If a full specification is too long to give here, refer to other documentation/publication
