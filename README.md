# SuperLim

This repository contains the template that must be used for the documentation of all SuperLim resources.

Instruction: 
1. If several versions of the template are available, use the latest one. Do not remove fields, do not rename them. You may add fields, but only in Block VI (OTHER). If you think the template has to be changed, contact the guldgruppen (sb-guld@svenska.gu.se).
2. The final product of your work should be a tsv file with two columns. An example is provided in this repo; do also have a look at other resources that have already been documented.
3. Name the file {resourcename}_documentation_sheet.tsv and make it available on your resource page (via Metashare).
4. Convert the file to html and add the table as the resource description (edit {resourcename}_eng.html in the resurstext folder via SVN). A simple Ruby script that converts tsv to html is provided in this repo, see comments within the script for usage. In the future, this process will probably be automatized.
5. There is currently no Swedish version of the template. If you want to make one, you are very welcome.
